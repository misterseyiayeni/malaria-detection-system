## <b>Problem Definition </b>

#### **Context: Why is this problem important to solve?**
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through infected Anopheles mosquito bites. It significantly impacts global health, causing severe complications, especially in children under 5, who are the most vulnerable. Traditional diagnosis is time-consuming and requires high expertise, which can lead to variability in results. Automated detection using AI and ML can improve accuracy and speed, potentially saving many lives.

#### **Objectives: What is the intended goal?**
The goal is to develop an efficient computer vision model that can accurately detect malaria. The model should be able to classify images of red blood cells as either parasitized (infected with malaria) or uninfected, thus aiding in early and accurate diagnosis.

#### **Key Questions: What are the key questions that need to be answered?**
1. How can we leverage AI and ML to improve the accuracy of malaria detection?
2. What are the best deep learning algorithms for this classification task?
3. How can the model be trained to distinguish between parasitized and uninfected red blood cells?
4. What metrics will be used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance?
5. How can this model be implemented in real-world settings for automated diagnosis?

#### **Problem Formulation: What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?**
We aim to solve the problem of slow and potentially inaccurate manual malaria detection by developing a deep learning model that can automatically and accurately classify red blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. This will streamline the diagnosis process, reduce dependency on human expertise, and ultimately contribute to more timely and effective treatment for malaria patients.

## <b>Data Description </b>

There are a total of 24,958 train and 2,600 test images (colored) that we have taken from microscopic images. These images are of the following categories:<br>


**Parasitized:** The parasitized cells contain the Plasmodium parasite which causes malaria<br>
**Uninfected:** The uninfected cells are free of the Plasmodium parasites<br>
